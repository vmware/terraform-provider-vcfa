## Developing the Provider

When developing `terraform-provider-vcfa` one often needs to modify the underlying `go-vcloud-director` SDK to consume
new methods and types. Go has a convenient [replace](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules#when-should-i-use-the-replace-directive)
directive which can allow you to redirect the import path to your own version of `go-vcloud-director`:

```go
module github.com/vmware/terraform-provider-vcfa
require (
    ...
    github.com/vmware/go-vcloud-director/v3 v3.1.0-alpha.3
)

replace github.com/vmware/go-vcloud-director/v3 v3.1.0-alpha.3 => github.com/my-git-user/go-vcloud-director/v3 v3.1.0-alpha.3    
```

You can also replace pointer to a branch with relative directory:

```go
 module github.com/vmware/terraform-provider-vcfa
 require (
    ...
    github.com/vmware/go-vcloud-director/v3 v3.1.0-alpha.2
)

replace github.com/vmware/go-vcloud-director/v3 v3.1.0-alpha.2 => ../go-vcloud-director
```
