# vcfa\_org\_networking

Provides a resource to manage Organization Networking Settings in VMware Cloud Foundation Automation.

_Used by: **Provider**_

-> For general Organization settings, see [`vcfa_org_settings`](/providers/vmware/vcfa/latest/docs/resources/org_settings) resource

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "vcfa_org" "demo" {
  name = "my-org-name"
}

resource "vcfa_org_networking" "demo" {
  org_id   = data.vcfa_org.demo.id
  log_name = "org1"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

- `org_id` - (Required) An [Organization][vcfa_org] ID for which the Networking Settings are to be changed
- `log_name` - (Required) A globally unique identifier for this [Organization][vcfa_org] in the logs of the
  backing network provider. Must be 1-8 chars length.

## Attribute Reference

The following attributes are exported on this resource:

- `networking_tenancy_enabled` - Whether this [Organization][vcfa_org] has tenancy for the network domain in the
  backing network provider

## Importing

~> **Note:** The current implementation of Terraform import can only import resources into the
state. It does not generate configuration. However, an experimental feature in Terraform 1.5+ allows
also code generation. See [Importing resources][importing-resources] for more information.

An existing Organization Networking Settings configuration can be [imported][docs-import] into this resource via supplying path
for it. An example is below:

```
terraform import vcfa_org_networking.imported my-org-name
```

_NOTE_: The default separator `.` can be changed using provider's `import_separator` argument or environment variable `VCFA_IMPORT_SEPARATOR`

The above would import the `my-org-name` Organization Networking settings.

After that, you can expand the configuration file and either update or delete the Organization Networking settings as needed. Running `terraform plan`
at this stage will show the difference between the minimal configuration file and the Organization Networking settings' stored properties.
