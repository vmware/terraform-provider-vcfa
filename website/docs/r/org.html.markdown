# vcfa\_org

Provides a resource to manage Organizations in VMware Cloud Foundation Automation.

_Used by: **Provider**_

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "vcfa_org" "test" {
  name         = "terraform-org"
  display_name = "Terraform Organization"
  description  = "Created with Terraform"
  is_enabled   = true
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

- `name` - (Required) The unique identifier in the full URL with which users log in to this Organization.
  To update this argument, the Organization must be disabled to or transition from previous disabled state
  (`is_enabled=false`) because the update changes tenant login URL
- `display_name` - (Required) A human-readable name for Organization
- `description` - (Optional) An optional description for Organization
- `is_enabled` - (Optional) Defines if Organization is enabled. Default `true`. **Note:**
  Organization has to be disabled before removal and this resource will automatically disable it if
  the resource is destroyed.
- `is_classic_tenant` - (Optional) Defines if this Organization is a classic VRA style tenant. Defaults to `false`. Cannot be
  changed after creation (changing it will force the re-creation of the Organization)

## Attribute Reference

The following attributes are exported on this resource:

- `managed_by_id` - ID of the Organization that owns this Organization
- `managed_by_name` - Name of Organization that owns this Organization
- `org_region_quota_count` - Number of Region Quotas belonging to this Organization
- `catalog_count` - Number of catalogs belonging to this Organization
- `vapp_count` - Number of vApps belonging to this Organization
- `running_vm_count` - Number of running VMs belonging to this Organization
- `user_count` - Number of users belonging to this Organization
- `disk_count` - Number of disks belonging to this Organization
- `can_publish` - Defines if this Organization can publish catalogs externally

## Importing

~> **Note:** The current implementation of Terraform import can only import resources into the
state. It does not generate configuration. However, an experimental feature in Terraform 1.5+ allows
also code generation. See [Importing resources][importing-resources] for more information.

An existing Organization configuration can be [imported][docs-import] into this resource via supplying path
for it. An example is below:

```
terraform import vcfa_org.imported my-org-name
```

_NOTE_: The default separator `.` can be changed using provider's `import_separator` argument or environment variable `VCFA_IMPORT_SEPARATOR`

The above would import the `my-org-name` Organization settings.

After that, you can expand the configuration file and either update or delete the Organization as needed. Running `terraform plan`
at this stage will show the difference between the minimal configuration file and the Organization's stored properties.
