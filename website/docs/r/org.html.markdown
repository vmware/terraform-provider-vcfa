# vcfa\_org

Provides a resource to manage VMware Cloud Foundation Automation Organizations.

~> Only `System Administrator` can create this resource.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "vcfa_org" "test" {
  name         = "terraform-org"
  display_name = "Terraform Organization"
  description  = "Created with Terraform"
  is_enabled   = true
}
```
## Example Usage (sub-provider)

```hcl
resource "vcfa_org" "test" {
  name           = "subprovider-org"
  display_name   = "Sub-provider Organization"
  is_enabled     = true
  is_subprovider = true
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) A name for Organization with which users log in to it as it will be used in
  the URL. The Org must be disabled to or transition from previous disabled state
  (`is_enabled=false`) to change a name because it changes tenant login URL
* `display_name` - (Required) A human-readable name for Organization
* `description` - (Optional) An optional description for Organization
* `is_enabled` - (Optional) Defines if Organization is enabled. Default `true`. **Note:**
  Organization has to be disabled before removal and this resource will automatically disable it if
  the resource is destroyed.
* `is_subprovider` - (Optional) Enables this Organization to manage other Organizations. **Note**:
  This value cannot be updated as there may be any number of Rights Bundles granting sub-provider rights
  to this Org. Instead, unpublish any rights bundles that have the `Org Traverse` right from this Org.
  This can be toggled to true to automatically perform the following steps:
  * Publish the Default Sub-Provider Entitlement Rights Bundle to the Organization
  * Publish the Sub-Provider Administrator global role (if it exists) to the Organization
  * Create a Default Rights Bundle in the Organization containing all publishable rights that are
    currently published to the Organization and mark that Rights Bundle as publish all.
  * Clone all default roles currently published to the Organization into Global Roles in the
    Organization and marks them all publish all.
* `is_classic_tenant` - (Optional) Defines if this Organization is a classic VRA style tenant. Defaults to `false`. Cannot be
  changed after creation (changing it will force the re-creation of the Organization)

## Attribute Reference

* `managed_by_id` - ID of Org that owns this Org
* `managed_by_name` - Name of Org that owns this Org
* `org_vdc_count` - Number of VDCs belonging to this Organization
* `catalog_count` - Number of catalogs belonging to this Organization
* `vapp_count` - Number of vApps belonging to this Organization
* `running_vm_count` - Number of running VMs belonging to this Organization
* `user_count` - Number of users belonging to this Organization

## Importing

~> **Note:** The current implementation of Terraform import can only import resources into the
state. It does not generate configuration. However, an experimental feature in Terraform 1.5+ allows
also code generation. See [Importing resources][importing-resources] for more information.

An existing Org configuration can be [imported][docs-import] into this resource via supplying path
for it. An example is below:

[docs-import]: https://www.terraform.io/docs/import/

```
terraform import vcfa_org.imported my-org-name
```

The above would import the `my-org-name` Organization settings.
