# vcfa\_org\_regional\_networking\_vpc\_qos

Provides a resource to manage [Organization Regional Networking][vcfa_org_regional_networking] VPC QoS settings in
VMware Cloud Foundation Automation.

_Used by: **Provider**_

-> Organization Regional Networking VPC inherits QoS settings from the [Edge Cluster][vcfa_edge_cluster_qos] by default, but
one can use this resource to override provided defaults. Deleting this resource will revert the
settings back to Edge Cluster defaults.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "vcfa_org" "demo" {
  name = "my-org-name"
}

data "vcfa_org_regional_networking" "demo" {
  name   = "my-name"
  org_id = vcfa_org.demo.id
}

resource "vcfa_org_regional_networking_vpc_qos" "demo" {
  org_regional_networking_id       = vcfa_org_regional_networking.demo.id
  ingress_committed_bandwidth_mbps = 14
  ingress_burst_size_bytes         = 15
  egress_committed_bandwidth_mbps  = 16
  egress_burst_size_bytes          = 17
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

- `org_regional_networking_id` - (Required) The ID of [Organization Regional Networking][vcfa_org_regional_networking] configuration
- `egress_committed_bandwidth_mbps` - (Optional) Committed egress bandwidth specified in Mbps.
  Bandwidth is limited to line rate. Traffic exceeding bandwidth will be dropped. Required with
  `egress_burst_size_bytes`. Default is `-1` (unlimited)
- `egress_burst_size_bytes` - (Optional) Egress burst size in bytes. Required with
  `egress_committed_bandwidth_mbps`. Default is `-1` (unlimited)
- `ingress_committed_bandwidth_mbps` - (Optional) Committed ingress bandwidth specified in Mbps.
  Bandwidth is limited to line rate. Traffic exceeding bandwidth will be dropped. Required with
  `ingress_burst_size_bytes`. Default is `-1` (unlimited)
- `ingress_burst_size_bytes` - (Optional) Ingress burst size in bytes. Required with
  `ingress_committed_bandwidth_mbps`. Default is `-1` (unlimited)

## Attribute Reference

- `edge_cluster_id` - ID of parent Edge Cluster

## Importing

~> **Note:** The current implementation of Terraform import can only import resources into the
state. It does not generate configuration. However, an experimental feature in Terraform 1.5+ allows
also code generation. See [Importing resources][importing-resources] for more information.

An existing Regional Networking Configuration can be [imported][docs-import] into this resource via supplying path
for it. An example is below:

```
terraform import vcfa_org_regional_networking_vpc_qos.imported my-org-name.my-regional-configuration-name
```

_NOTE_: The default separator `.` can be changed using provider's `import_separator` argument or environment variable `VCFA_IMPORT_SEPARATOR`

The above would import the Regional Networking VPC QoS settings that are defined by the `my-regional-configuration-name`
Regional Networking Configuration Settings present in the `my-org-name` Organization.

After that, you can expand the configuration file and either update or delete the Regional Networking VPC QoS as needed. Running `terraform plan`
at this stage will show the difference between the minimal configuration file and the Regional Networking VPC QoS' stored properties.
