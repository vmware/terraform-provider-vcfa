# vcfa\_org\_regional\_networking\_vpc\_qos

Provides a resource to manage VMware Cloud Foundation Automation Organization Regional Networking VPC QoS settings.

-> Organization Regional Networking VPC inherits QoS settings from the Edge Cluster by default, but
one can use this resource to override provided defaults. Deleting this resource will revert the
settings back to Edge Cluster defaults.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "vcfa_org" "demo" {
  name = "my-org-name"
}

data "vcfa_org_regional_networking" "demo" {
  name   = "my-name"
  org_id = vcfa_org.demo.id
}

resource "vcfa_org_regional_networking_vpc_qos" "demo" {
  org_regional_networking_id       = vcfa_org_regional_networking.demo.id
  ingress_committed_bandwidth_mbps = 14
  ingress_burst_size_bytes         = 15
  egress_committed_bandwidth_mbps  = 16
  egress_burst_size_bytes          = 17
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

- `org_regional_networking_id` - (Required) The ID of Organization Regional Networking configuration
- `egress_committed_bandwidth_mbps` - (Optional) Committed egress bandwidth specified in Mbps.
  Bandwidth is limited to line rate. Traffic exceeding bandwidth will be dropped. Required with
  `egress_burst_size_bytes`. Default is `-1` - unlimited
- `egress_burst_size_bytes` - (Optional) Egress burst size in bytes. Required with
  `egress_committed_bandwidth_mbps`. Default is `-1` - unlimited
- `ingress_committed_bandwidth_mbps` - (Optional) Committed ingress bandwidth specified in Mbps.
  Bandwidth is limited to line rate. Traffic exceeding bandwidth will be dropped. Required with
  `ingress_burst_size_bytes`. Default is `-1` - unlimited
- `ingress_burst_size_bytes` - (Optional) Ingress burst size in bytes. Required with
  `ingress_committed_bandwidth_mbps`. Default is `-1` - unlimited



## Attribute Reference

- `edge_cluster_id` - ID of parent Edge Cluster

## Importing

~> **Note:** The current implementation of Terraform import can only import resources into the
state. It does not generate configuration. However, an experimental feature in Terraform 1.5+ allows
also code generation. See [Importing resources][importing-resources] for more information.

An existing Regional Networking Configuration can be [imported][docs-import] into this resource via supplying path
for it. An example is below:

[docs-import]: https://www.terraform.io/docs/import/

```
terraform import vcfa_org_regional_networking.imported my-org-name.my-regional-configuration-name
```

The above would import the `my-regional-configuration-name` Regional Networking Configuration
Settings that are defined for `my-org-name` Organization.
